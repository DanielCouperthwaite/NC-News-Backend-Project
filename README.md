# Welcome

Welcome to a publically accessible api to create a news website.

To get started, please create a new environment variable for each database you wish to work with. You can see the .env-example file to use as an example.

In each file, you should add the name of your database to the following line. So  PGDATABASE=database_name_here will contain the name of your local data.

You can create a different file for test, development and user data, but each must have their own corresponding environment file.
